# Socket server

This project is hosted at [socket-server](https://socket-server.sonnerberg.me/),
but to use it you have to go to
[Websocket chat](https://socket-client.sonnerberg.me/).

## Timezone

To use Swedish timezone I had to run `sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Stockholm` on the server.
