# Socket server

This project is hosted at [socket-server](https://socket-server.sonnerberg.me/),
but to use it you have to go to
[Websocket chat](https://socket-client.sonnerberg.me/).

## Timezone

To use Swedish timezone first ran
`sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Stockholm` on the server.

But it's probably better to speficy `timeZone` in `node`.
